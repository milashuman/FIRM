							<h3></h3>
							<p>
							
							The American Immigration Council, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, is a powerful voice in promoting laws, policies, and attitudes that honor our proud history as a nation of immigrants. Through research and policy analysis, litigation and communications, and international exchange, the Council seeks to shape a twenty-first century vision of the American immigrant experience.
							</p>

								<h3>What we do:</h3>
								<p>We use the courts to demand a fair judicial process for immigrants and to stand up for their rights.</p>
							</header>
							<p>The Council works to achieve justice and fairness for immigrants under the law.  The Council is highly respected for its willingness and ability to bring cutting-edge lawsuits that hold the government accountable for unlawful conduct and restrictive interpretations and implementation of the law.</p>
							<header>
								<h3></h3>
								<p>We use the facts to educate the public on the important and enduring contributions that immigrants make to America. </p>
							</header>
							<p>The Council is a national leader in challenging the myths and misinformation that too often dominate the political and public debate around immigration. Through research and analysis, the Council promotes the development of fair and rational immigration policies that reflect fundamental American values.</p>
							<header>
								<h3></h3>
								<p>We use cultural exchange to connect American businesses with the global market of ideas and innovation.</p>
							</header>
							<p>The Council sponsors interns and trainees for programs that secure the prosperity and cultural richness of a globally engaged society. Our experts provide direct support and training to participants, host communities, and attorneys involved in the Exchange Visitor Program.
								<br />
								In all its work, the Council seeks out and promotes the problem-solvers and creative thinkers who can help us shape a more humane and fair approach to immigrationâ€”not only as a matter of law and policy, but also as a tool for continuing to protect and nourish the values of tolerance and dignity on which the United States was founded.</p>

							<header>
								<h4>Why we do it:</h4>
							</header>
							<p>The American Immigration Council, established in 1987, works to strengthen America by honoring our immigrant history and shaping how America thinks about and acts towards immigrants and immigration.
								<br />
								We believe that everyone deserves an opportunity to present their immigration claims in a fair and orderly way.<br />
								We hold that our doors must be open to those who come to the United States in search of safety and protection.<br />
								We believe that immigrants strengthen America by bringing skills, talents, and new energy to our economy.<br />
								We believe in honest debates driven by the facts, not fear. </p>
